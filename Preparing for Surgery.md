Types ofAnesthesia

> In this chapter I will give you two things. The official definition of
> the word(s) and the simplified version by me.
>
> **MAC/Sedation** **Anesthesia:** MAC is Monitored Anesthesia Care.
> This type of anesthesia is usually used in conjunction with other
> types of anesthesia described below such as a regional or local for
> something small like stitching up a cut or even an outpatient
> colonoscopy.
>
> The definition of MAC is a type of anesthesia service where a patient
> is monitored and managed by an anesthesia provider during a procedure
> that usually requires sedation, analgesia (pain relief), and possibly
> anxiolysis (anxiety relief). MAC typically allows the patient to
> remain in varying levels of consciousness, from fully awake but
> relaxed to lightly sedated or even asleep. The anesthesia provider
> carefully monitors the patient’s vital signs, including heart rate,
> blood pressure, oxygen
>
> CHAPTER 1
>
> levels, and respiration, and is prepared to convert to general
> anesthesia if the need arises. MAC can be used in various procedures
> where full unconsciousness is not required, thus providing a balance
> between safety, comfort, and adequate sedation.
>
> • So basically we (an anesthesia provider) hook you up to our monitors
> to watch your vital signs. Each heart beat, breath taken, your oxygen
> saturation and blood pressure while giving you medicine so you won’t
> care that something is happening to your body while you are awake.
> This type of anesthesia means you will be awake but wont mind that you
> are. I equate this type of anesthesia to drinking a few big glasses of
> your favorite alcoholic beverage. If you’re underage, we are about to
> give your parents some ammo and they will be able to recognize if you
> ever decide to partake when you shouldn’t be… sorry…not…lol.
>
> **General** **Anesthesia:** This type of anesthesia is the most widely
> used and has a long range of uses from colonoscopies (general
> unconscious sedation) to the more common appendix removal surgery, to
> big things like open heart surgery.

The definition of General Anesthesia is a medically induced, free from
perception of pain, reversible state of unconsciousness, amnesia (loss
of memory), muscle relaxation, and loss of reflexes. It is commonly
ad-ministered to patients undergoing major surgical procedures that
would otherwise be intolerable or dangerous to experience while
conscious.

> During general anesthesia, the patient’s vital signs, such as heart
> rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and respiration, are closely

>
> PREPARING FOR SURGERY
>
> by an anesthesia provider. The anesthesia may be delivered through
> inhaled gasses or intravenous medications, and ensures that the
> patient remains unconscious and free from pain throughout the duration
> of the procedure.

**The** **key** **components** **of** **general** **anesthesia**
**include:**

> 1.Unconsciousness: The patient is completely unaware and unresponsive
> sive.
>
> 2.Analgesia: The patient does not feel pain.
>
> 3.Amnesia: The patient has no memory of the procedure.
>
> 4\. (specific surgeries) Muscle Relaxation: The patient’s muscles are
> relaxed, which is particularly important for procedures involving
> significant muscle manipulation or control.

Recovery from general anesthesia typically involves a transition period
where the patient regains consciousness in a controlled environment and
is monitored for any adverse effects until they are stable.

> • Simply put, general anesthesia is when you go all the way to sleep
> and will have no memory of the surgery happening. The anesthesia
> provider may use a breathing tube to breathe for you *or* you may be
> able to have a soft oral airway placed so that you can breathe on your
> own while having surgery. In some specific cases you will not even
> need any type of airway device at all. You will simply be sleeping as
> if you were at home taking a nap. Whichever type is used will be
> determined by the type of surgery you’re having and your personal
> medical history. The anesthetist will make sure you are safe and
> comfortable all along the way.
>
> CHAPTER 1
>
> • After this type of anesthesia you will typically go to a recovery
> room known as the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) where a nurse will
> closely watch you to ensure you are coming out of the anesthesia
> safely. Then you will be taken back to your room to see your family.
> You will then be discharged to another area of the hospital or back
> home depending on the type of surgery and your personal needs.

**Spinal** **and** **Epidural:**

Spinal and epidural anesthesia are both types of regional anesthesia
that are used to numb parts of the body, most commonly during surgical
procedures involving the lower abdomen, pelvis, and legs. Both
techniques involve injecting anesthetic medications near the spinal
cord, but they differ in their specific methods and effects.

***Spinal*** ***Anesthesia:***

> • Definition: Spinal anesthesia involves the injection of a local
> anes-thetic into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds the
> spinal cord.
>
> • Procedure: The injection is typically done with a fine (very small)
> needle that is inserted between the vertebrae, usually in the lower
> back (lumbar region).
>
> • Onset and Duration: Spinal anesthesia generally provides fast onset
> of anesthesia (within a few minutes) and is typically used for shorter
> procedures.
>
> • Usage: Commonly used for surgeries like cesarean sections, lower
> abdominal surgeries, and lower limb surgeries.
>
> • Effect: Patients can remain conscious but do not feel pain in the
> numbed region. The effects can last for a few hours.
>
> PREPARING FOR SURGERY
>
> ***Epidural*** ***Anesthesia:***
>
> • Definition: Epidural anesthesia involves the injection of anesthetic
> medication into the epidural space.
>
> • Procedure: A catheter may be placed into the epidural space through
> a needle. This allows for continuous infusion or intermittent
> injection of anesthetic medicine, which can be adjusted as needed.
>
> • Onset and Duration: The onset of epidural anesthesia is generally
> slower compared to spinal anesthesia. However, the duration can be
> extended through repeated dosing using the catheter.
>
> • Usage: Commonly used for labor and delivery, as well as for
> surgeries where prolonged pain control is needed, such as major
> abdominal or thoracic surgeries.
>
> • Effect: Provides partial anesthesia and can vary based on dosage and
> location of injection. Patients remain conscious and can also have
> partial motor function preserved depending on the medication used.
>
> ***Key*** ***Differences:*** 1.Location of Injection:
>
> • Spinal anesthesia is injected into the spinal space.
>
> • Epidural anesthesia is injected outside the spinal space.

2.Onset and Duration:

> • Spinal anesthesia has a quicker onset and is generally used for
> shorter procedures.
>
> • Epidural anesthesia has a slower onset and can be maintained for
> longer durations.
>
> CHAPTER 1

3.Catheter Usage:

> • Spinal anesthesia is generally a single injection.
>
> • Epidural anesthesia often involves the use of a catheter for
> continu-ous or intermittent medicine administration.
>
> Both types of anesthesia require careful monitoring by an anesthesia
> provider to ensure patient safety and effective pain control.
>
> • Basically the spinal will numb you up and take away your ability to
> move from the upper waist down. It also takes away the ability to feel
> pain. You may still feel touch and pressure. For example: It’s like
> going to the dentist and having your tooth numbed for a filling to be
> done. For me I can’t feel any pain but can still feel that the dentist
> is working in that general area.
>
> • Either type, spinal or epidural, anesthesia can be used for a
> c-section, typically no sedation would be given. We want you to
> remember the birth of your child. For a planned c-section we mostly
> use a spinal technique. For someone who was in labor and was given an
> epidural but then needed to be taken for a c-section, we can add
> medicine to the epidural and use that for the surgery.
>
> **Regional** **and** **Local** **Anesthesia:** This type of anesthesia
> is for a specific area of the body. Typically used in conjunction with
> the MAC/Sedation or even with General anesthesia. Usually regional
> anesthesia is used for
>
> PREPARING FOR SURGERY

post-operative pain relief. A good example would be regional anesthesia
used to numb up a shoulder and arm for a shoulder surgery. The patient
would go to sleep under general anesthesia for the surgery itself but
would have the regional block placed with sedation prior to the surgery
so when they woke up the pain would not be so pronounced.

> ***Local*** ***Anesthesia:***
>
> • Definition: Local anesthesia involves the injection or topical
> appli-cation of anesthetic agents to a small, specific area of the
> body to numb that particular region.
>
> • Procedure: It is usually applied directly to the targeted area, or
> injected into the tissues where the procedure will occur.
>
> • Onset and Duration: The onset of local anesthesia is typically
> within minutes, and its duration varies depending on the type of
> anesthetic used. It often wears off within a few hours.
>
> • Usage: Commonly used for minor surgical procedures, dental work, and
> other localized interventions like stitching a small wound.
>
> • Effect: Provides temporary loss of sensation in the targeted area,
> allowing the patient to remain fully conscious and aware during the
> procedure.
>
> ***Regional*** ***Anesthesia:***
>
> • Definition: Regional anesthesia involves the use of anesthetic drugs
> to block sensation in a larger part of the body, often affecting a
> limb or the lower half of the body. This is typically accomplished by
> targeting specific nerves or a group of nerves.
>
> • Procedure: The anesthetic is administered near major nerve bundles
> or into specific areas such as the spinal cord. Techniques for
> regional
>
> CHAPTER 1
>
> anesthesia include spinal blocks, epidurals, and nerve blocks.
>
> • Onset and Duration: The onset and duration can vary depending on the
> type of regional anesthesia and the anesthetics used. It can range
> from rapid to moderately slow onset with durations that can be managed
> through continuous infusions.
>
> • Usage: Commonly used for orthopedic surgeries, childbirth (epidu-
>
> ral for labor), lower abdominal surgeries, and other procedures where
> localized sensation loss is beneficial without rendering the patient
> unconscious.
>
> • Effect: The patient will experience loss of sensation and possibly
> muscle function in the area innervated by the targeted nerves but will
> remain fully conscious and alert.
>
> ***Key*** ***Points:***
>
> 1.Local Anesthesia:
>
> • Targets a small, specific area.
>
> • Applied topically or injected into the tissues. • Rapid onset,
> shorter duration.

2.Regional Anesthesia:

> • Affects a larger region, such as an entire limb or the lower half of
> the body.
>
> • Administered by targeting major nerve bundles or the spinal cord.
>
> • Variable onset and duration can be extended through continuous drug
> delivery.

Both types of anesthesia are designed to block sensation to prevent pain

> PREPARING FOR SURGERY
>
> during medical procedures, but they are applied on different scales
> and for different purposes. Local anesthesia is ideal for minor,
> localized procedures, while regional anesthesia is suitable for more
> extensive areas requiring surgical or procedural intervention.
>
> • Simply stated, regional anesthesia is like the spinal for the lower
> half of the body or a dense block of an arm for a shoulder, upper or
> lower arm surgery. There are also regional field blocks that can numb
> up the front of your abdomen for another area of pain relief.
>
> • Local anesthesia is more “localized”, hence the name local. It is
> more direct and to the point. This would probably be used for a small
> surgery on the foot, a toe, a finger, a small spot somewhere on the
> body. Usually these local things are done along with a MAC for anxiety
> relief.

**TIVA:** **Total** **Intravenous** **Anesthesia:** This means that the
only type of anesthesia you will get is through your IV. This is
typically used for the colonoscopies and upper endoscopies procedures.
Or during a case where the spinal anesthesia is being used and the
patient requires something to sleep through the surgery. Also, we
usually do this when someone has had a very bad reaction to the
anesthesia gasses that we use to keep you asleep.

> Prep for Surgery - The Days Before

There are a lot of things to be done before you have elective surgery.
Of course things happen and emergency surgeries are bound to pop up, but
this is for the planned and scheduled surgical stuff.

> **Meeting** **with** **your** **surgeon**

This might go without saying but you should always have a meeting with
your surgeon before the day of the surgery. There are some places that
have you see the NP or PA most or all of the time. They may tell you
that surgery is needed, then they handle the scheduling and get
everything all set up. I personally am not the biggest fan of this
approach. Although it is nice to have everything done for you, I would
hate to not know who is going to be cutting into me. Sure they would
tell me the name of the surgeons in the group but which one specifically
is going to be taking care of me? I want to do a little research on that
person and make sure they are right for the job. Sometimes we don’t have
the

> PREPARING FOR SURGERY
>
> option to do this, but when there is time it is definitely
> recommended. I’ve also found that in between meeting with the surgeon
> and the day of surgery I may have some more questions or concerns I
> need addressed before the big event. In that case I always write down
> everything and bring with me the day of surgery. If you’re anything
> like me I get in my head and forget some of the stuff I wanted to ask.
> This ensures I get all my questions asked and answered and I can go
> into my surgery feeling good about what is going to happen.
>
> **PAT** **appointment:** **Pre** **Anesthesia** **Testing**

PAT goes by various names at different institutions. At hospitals where
I have worked it was at this appointment the nurse would get your
baseline vital signs, your height and weight, you may have an EKG to see
your heart rhythm, have blood drawn, have a chest x-ray, and various
other tests done that your medical team deems appropriate. Usually you
will also talk with an anesthesia provider at this appointment to be
sure your anesthesia plan is laid out and all questions can be answered.
This is when we will tell you what type of anesthesia we plan to
administer for your specific surgery. Your anesthesia professional may
also advise you on what medicines to be sure you take or skip for your
surgery.

> **Surgical** **consent**

When you meet with your surgeon they should be going over your consent
for surgery and explaining what exactly they will be doing in the
surgery. This is a legal document that you are signing to give
permission for them to cut on you, my advice is make sure you know what
you are signing and what contingencies there are if something should
arise in the surgery. Ask as many questions as you think necessary and
don’t worry, there are no silly questions when it comes to your surgery,
be sure you are absolutely comfortable with what the plan is.

“NPO” stands for the Latin phrase “nil per os,” which means “nothing by
mouth.” Anesthesia providers use this to indicate that a patient should
not consume any food or liquids orally. This guideline is typically
enforced before surgery or anesthesia to reduce the risk of aspiration.
Aspiration is when stomach contents are regurgitated and inhaled into
the lungs. This is a big problem that could cause serious complications
like pneumonia.

> **Here** **are** **key** **aspects** **of** **NPO** **in**
> **anesthesia:**
>
> • Purpose: To minimize the risk of aspiration during anesthetic
> procedures by ensuring the stomach is empty.
>
> • Duration: Patients are usually advised to be NPO for specific
> periods of time, such as fasting from solid food for 6-8 hours and
> from clear fluids for 2-4 hours before anesthesia.
>
> • Each facility will have their own set of guidelines on the NPO
> guidelines used for each patient’s particular situation and surgery.
>
> • Instruction: Patients are given clear guidelines on what they can
> and cannot consume during the NPO period, often including restric-
> tions on chewing gum, sucking on candy, and smoking or tobacco
> dips/chew.
>
> Specifically, the goal of NPO status before anesthesia is to make the
> surgical procedure safer by reducing the risk of complications
> associated
>
> PREPARING FOR SURGERY
>
> with anesthesia. When you’re relaxed (even with anxiety-reducing
> meds), your muscles and reflexes don’t act the same and anything in
> your stomach can get into your lungs and that could be a very critical
> problem.
>
> Depending on the type of surgery your doctor will advise you on what
> to eat or not eat leading up the day before the surgery. Some
> surgeries require an extended fasting time or certain foods to be
> avoided. This is why it is important to make sure to get detailed
> instructions prior to the surgery date. Drinking is somewhat a
> different matter. Different hospitals have different protocols for
> certain surgeries. Again, check and double check what the protocol for
> your specific surgical procedure is prior to the day of surgery.
>
> When it comes to drinking there are some differing opinions. As an
> anes-thesia provider we are given a set of guidelines by the American
> Society of Anesthesiologists. Different drinks have different waiting
> periods and different people on different medicines change the
> requirements as well. So I cannot give advice with absolute certainty
> on this particular subject. You will need to consult your anesthetist
> for clear cut instructions. You may be told to drink a specific drink
> the morning of for the surgery you are having. Or it may be possible
> that you can drink plain water up to 2 hours prior to going to the
> hospital for your surgery.
>
> <u>Each and every surgical procedure carries its own special set of
> rules.</u> The important thing to know is we tell you what is best for
> you to have the best possible outcome.

What I can say is that there are a few things you can do to help better
your outcome. <u>Rest and h</u>y<u>dration</u> are two of the simplest
things we can do for ourselves. Getting the appropriate amount of sleep
will help your

> CHAPTER 2
>
> body prepare as well as staying hydrated in the days leading up to
> your surgery. A good rule of thumb for water is to drink half your
> body weight in ounces each day. For example, if you weigh 100 pounds,
> you should drink 50 ounces of water each day (24 hours). And as a
> bonus when you’re properly hydrated it will be much easier for the
> nurse to place your IV, thus preventing you from becoming a pin
> cushion.

**What** **to** **wear** **to** **the** **hospital**

> It is usually best advised to wear loose comfy clothing with
> comfortable shoes (like sneakers) and socks. Living in the Southeast
> there’s a lot of flip-flop wearing and unfortunately that is the worst
> thing to come to the hospital in. If you’re having surgery on your
> head or neck you should probably wear a button up shirt so you’re not
> having to pull something over your head after surgery. For a surgery
> on your stomach consider drawstring pants or shorts or even a cute
> muumuu. For toe surgery I would avoid footy pajamas. See where I’m
> goin with this. Consider clothing like this - picture a big bandage
> over the area being operated on and you have to get your clothes
> on/off without messing it up and keeping clean.
>
> **Medicine** **and** **supplies**
>
> Sometimes prior to your surgery your doctor will give you prescript-
>
> tions that will need to be filled for post operative care. If so,
> please get them filled prior to the day of surgery. It will make
> everyone’s life so much easier. Same thing for other supplies you may
> need. Do your due diligence and see what is recommended for home care
> and get it prior to needing it. <u>It</u> <u>is</u> b<u>etter to have
> it and not need it, than to need it and not</u> <u>have it.</u> It may
> be something simple like heating pads or ice packs for rotating on the
> surgical site. Be sure to clarify with your surgeon on this prior to
> purchase.
>
> PREPARING FOR SURGERY
>
> **Needed** **documents**
>
> Make sure you have all of your paperwork from your doctor with you,
> preferably in an easy to locate folder or envelope. If it is needed by
> any part of the medical team at the hospital it is best to have it
> handy. Every surgical procedure comes with some sort of paperwork for
> preoperative and sometimes postoperative instructions and such. Be
> sure you read through all of this and have it available just in case.

Also compile a list of **all** the medicines you take. Include when you
take them, how often you are taking them, and the strength of the
medicine. <u>We need to know anything and everythin</u>g <u>you’re
taking.</u> Include over the counter (like Tylenol and aspirin) herbal
stuff (fish oil and zinc) and any prescriptions. You may think it’s not
important but trust me when I say it is. If it is taken any way other
than orally please make a note of that as well.

> Example of medicine list:
>
> • 50mg xyz, twice daily, morning and evening • 5mg xyz, every other
> day, evening
>
> • 10mg xyz, weekly injection, Sunday evenings
>
> **Support** **system**
>
> Anyone that comes for surgery and has any anesthesia cannot drive
> themselves home. This is the case for everywhere in the country, and
> for any type of anesthesia other than local anesthesia without any
> medicine from anyone, including oral medicine or otherwise. In fact
> the patient is not supposed to drive for 24 hours after receiving
> anesthesia. In some cases you will not be able to drive for days,
> weeks, or even months, depending on your surgery and doctors orders.
> Because of this it is
>
> CHAPTER 2

vital that you have a good support system. Usually we see the husbands,
wives, domestic partners, friends, or other family members there for
each-other. In any situation the support person needs to be at least 18
years old so they can be legally responsible for the patient. Some
surgeries require the support person to be around for days, weeks, and
sometimes months. In any case a good support person will help with
getting you home to rest, and obtaining all the discharge instructions
for you. Sometimes they will be needed to help you in and out of chairs
or the bed. Most of all having someone that truly cares for you when you
have gone through something traumatic like a surgery is always nice. You
know the saying “misery loves company,” and for me it was true.

> **Preparing** **your** **body** **-** **grooming** **and** **such**
>
> It is very important to be thoroughly clean for your surgery. Each

I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention teeth and overall dental care. Pretty
please with a cherry on top brush your teeth before leaving for the
hospital, taking care to not swallow anything. I can’t tell you how many
people neglect to brush their teeth because “who cares if I am just
going to be sleeping’’ Well, I care, a lot! If you have any kind of
false teeth in your mouth please do not glue them in on the day of
surgery. You can wear them in but we need to be able to remove them if
needed. This goes

The Day of Surgery

Be sure to wear clean clothes. You would think this is a no brainer, but
you’d be surprised at the number of people that show up in dirty
clothes. Honestly, you are supposed to sleep in clean sheets as well
after showering the night prior to your surgery. After doing all the
special washing and grooming for the surgery don’t go and ruin it by
wearing dirty clothes. The appropriate clothing and shoes is very
important for your comfort and outcome from the surgery. Yes, you will
have to change into a hospital gown once at the hospital, but eventually
you will be back in your own clothing and who wants to put on something
dirty and risk getting an infection because unwanted bacteria is close
to the surgical site?

>
> PREPARING FOR SURGERY

we may have to take it off once your turn comes up, and we don’t keep
the good facial cleanser at the hospitals, it is hospital grade cleaner
and not as gentle as you may hope. We are not doing this to be mean, but
instead for your safety. Allow me to explain. If we need to place a
breathing tube in your airway to keep you safe we also need to secure it
into place. If there is a lot of makeup on your face the tape will not
stick and we risk the breathing tube accidentally coming out. No
breathing tube equals no breathing until we get it back in. See what I’m
sayin’ - important. Along with that, we ensure your eyes are securely
closed so the likelihood of damage is minimized. If you have false
lashes on they may be inadvertently removed. While long bright colored
nails are pretty they can be problematic as well. We use a special
monitor to watch your blood oxygen levels while you are in surgery. If
our monitor cannot read through your false nails or nail polish we will
need to remove it. So it is best if you come to the hospital with at
least one fingernail on each hand in its natural state. I am partial to
the ring finger being used, it is said to have the vein that goes
straight to the heart, but any finger will likely do just fine.

>
> Remember those documents I had you gather up in the previous chapter?

>
> CHAPTER 3

Lastly, don’t forget you will need someone there that can make sure you
get home safely if you are having an outpatient type of surgery. At my
hospital you will literally not be able to go back for your surgery
until someone is in the hospital. In the previous area I described this
as your support system. This person will receive all your discharge
orders and be responsible for your well being.

What to Expect on the Day of Your Surgery

> You will be given an arrival time based on the surgical schedule and
> your specific surgery. A good rule of thumb is that we ask you to be
> at the hospital approximately 1-2 hours before we think your surgery
> will take place. There is a lot of stuff that goes into having a
> surgery, as you can now see. We need to get your registered, have the
> pre-operative nurse go over all the paperwork you were asked to bring,
> including medicines, your allergies, and your general information.
> Then you will be changing into the lovely hospital gown (the built-in
> AC is complimentary), the nurse will start your IV and take your vital
> signs. Also if you are a female who has not gone through menopause or
> had a hysterectomy you will have to give a urine sample or have blood
> drawn to confirm that you are not pregnant.
>
> After all that, the anesthesia provider assigned to your surgery will
> come speak with you. They will confirm everything and answer any
>
> CHAPTER 4
>

> anesthesia provider. We are not here to judge you, just take care of
> you, and we cannot do that if you leave out important details of your

Once all that checks out, the operating room (OR) nurse will come in and
verify everything once again (no I’m not kidding, you will be asked the
same questions what seems like a million times). It is how we ensure we
don’t operate on the wrong body part or do the wrong procedure. Usually
the anesthesia provider will be there as well and they will give you a
little relaxing medicine before you head off to the operating room. Once
you are in your OR, we will have you move over to the OR bed. It is
usually very long and narrow (kind of like laying on an ironing board)
and it is almost always cold and hard - sorry. The anesthetist will then
hook you up to all the monitors and have you breathe oxygen through a
face mask, please give us a heads up if you are claustrophobic so we can
make needed adjustments. I promise it is just oxygen, the sleep medicine
will go in your IV. The only time it would be an inhaled anesthetic is
if you cannot get an IV (like our little ones). Once we are happy with
your vital signs you will be given medicine in the IV and you will be
asleep in a few seconds. After you are asleep we will place the airway
device that we spoke with you about and link you with our anesthesia
machine that will deliver the anesthesia medicine to keep you asleep.
Once the surgeon is done with your surgery we will begin the wake up
process. The anesthetist will make sure you are strong enough to breathe
on your own prior to removing the airway device and then take you into
the recovery

As for the time at the hospital, in general I tell most patients to be
ready to be at the hospital for a long time, usually 4-6 hours is an
average amount of time. Think of it like this, by the time you get there
and go through all the beginning stuff before going back to the OR it’s
about 2 hours. Then the simplest surgeries take about an hour, it could
be a tooth brushing procedure and it will take an hour, not sure why, it
just does. For more complex surgeries it’s even longer. Then you have to
go to the recovery room (PACU) and then back to your room to be
discharged.

All that added up is about 4-6 hours. In some rare cases you can be in
and out faster, but that is truly the exception to the rule. Some
surgeries require you to stay at the hospital for one reason or another.
In that case you will be taken to your inpatient room directly from the
PACU and your support people will be advised as to where you will be.

• A lot of people think they will divulge all their deepest dark secrets
under anesthesia, like it’s some sort of a truth serum. Truth is that
most people don’t tell us much of anything. In most instances, once the
medications hit we see a lot of giggling and some confusion or
sleepiness, but no secrets are shared. It’s similar to having an adult
beverage.

• Do redheads really require more anesthesia? Honestly a lot of research
has been done on this and the only significant data comes from the
journal Anesthesiology in 2004; it showed that people with red hair that
had the MC1R gene mutation required up to 20% more anesthesia. As
someone practicing anesthesia for a long time I can say that more often
than not it is the patient’s medical history rather than their hair
color that determines how much anesthesia they may require.
